`facemenu-keymap' (normally bound to `M-o') has been disabled.
==============================================================

We've disabled the normal `M-o' keymap for a month (until March the
10th, 2021) in the development version of Emacs to see whether anybody
uses this feature.

If the removal of this key binding doesn't annoy too many people, the
plan is to then leave the it unbound, for usage by third-party
packages and users.

If you wish to restore the binding during the trial period, you can
put the following in your .emacs file:

(facemenu-keymap-restore)

After the trial period is over, the function will be removed.

If you wish to protest the removal of the `M-o' key binding, please
send your thoughts to the emacs-devel@gnu.org mailing list.
